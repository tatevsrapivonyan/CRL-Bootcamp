# Bitvector Implementation

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a bitvector (bit array) data structure in C++. A bitvector is a space-efficient data structure that compactly stores bits and allows for efficient manipulation and querying of individual bits.

## Features
- **Efficient Storage**: Compactly store a large number of bits.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Set, clear, toggle, and get the value of individual bits.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Perform bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
- **Performance**: Optimized for constant time operations where possible.
